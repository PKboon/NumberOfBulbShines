# NumberOfBulbShines
(This is something I found online and just wanted to code it.)  
Finds the number of moments for which every turned on bulb shines.

* There are N bulbs, numbered from 1 to N, arranged in a row.
The first bulb is plugged into the power socket and
each successive bulb is connected to the previous one
(the second bulb to the first, the third bulb to the second, etc.)
* Initially, all the bulbs are turned off. A bulb shines if it is on and all the
previuos bulbs are turned on too.
